## Unreleased

The first complete version of Diorama.

### Steering
- A local Anthropic Messages gateway for Claude Code sessions started with `diorama run` or the app. Diorama changes no global settings: routing applies only to sessions it starts.
- Tool results (WebFetch, WebSearch, Read, Bash, Grep, MCP…) are rewritten by a separate rewrite agent that uses your own Anthropic API key, stored in the macOS Keychain.
- Global rules come as versioned profiles, plus per-session prompts. Rewrite context is minimal by default, and a rule can opt in to see the session's task.
- Reproducible: each tool-result decision is made once and replayed byte-for-byte on later turns, which keeps the history consistent and the prompt cache warm.

### Auditing
- A live session timeline: requests, tool results, rewrites, cache usage, added latency, and what Claude did next.
- For every rewrite: the original and rewritten text with a diff, the rules with their content hashes and versions, the instructions, the rewrite attempts with model, cost and latency, and the explanation.

### Experiments
- A/B experiments: an unmodified control plus steered variants, with repeated `claude -p` trials in APFS clones of your project.
- Blocked randomization, frozen treatments, a reproducibility manifest for each trial, and a cost estimate that must be confirmed before a run starts.
- Comparisons keep observed facts separate from heuristic signals, with Wilson intervals, small-sample caveats and no causal claims. Reports can be exported as Markdown or JSON.

### Tooling
- A `diorama` CLI covering run, sessions, profiles, key, settings, daemon, doctor and experiment, plus a SwiftUI app and the `dioramad` background service, which is restarted if it crashes.
- Verified against the real Anthropic API with Claude Code 2.1.296.
